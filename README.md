# CO2-visualisation
Global Warming is at new heights and CO2 emissions are a major contributor of it. This here is a project which uses data visualization and
machine learning to monitor trend of CO2 emissions of all the countries and predict future emission values. 

Technology Stack
D3.js (Data Driven Document)-Used to plot and animate emissions trend of various countries from years 1850 to 2014. plot.ly can be used too.
Python and Libraries- Make the machine learning model to predict emissions
Javascript- Make the webpage
Flask-Link the ML model to the webpage
